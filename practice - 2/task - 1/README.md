# Task 1

## Triangle Class in C++

The class has three private member variables for the lengths of its three sides, and public member functions to access
these sides, calculate the triangle's perimeter and area, and construct the triangle with the given side lengths.

## Files

The implementation is divided into three files:

    Triangle.h: header file that defines the Triangle class and member function prototypes.
    Triangle.cpp: implementation file that contains the definitions of the Triangle class member functions.
    main.cpp: main file that creates a Triangle object and prints out its side lengths, perimeter, and area using the member functions.

## Tests

| Input      | Test                      |
|:-----------|:--------------------------|
| `3, 4, 5`  | `Triangle 1 is valid`     |
| `6, 8, 10` | `Triangle 2 is valid`     |
| `1, 2, 3`  | `Triangle 3 is not valid` |
